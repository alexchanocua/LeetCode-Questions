# Running a JavaScript File Using Node.js
1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the `.js` file you want to run.

2. Type the following command to run the `.js` file using Node.js:
```javascript
node filename.js
```
Replace `filename` with the actual name of the `.js` file you want to run.

3. Press enter to execute the command. The output of the script will be displayed in the terminal window.

For example, if you want to run a file called `twoSum.js` located in the `Arrays` folder, you would navigate to the `Arrays` folder in your terminal and type the following command:

```javascript
node twoSum.js
```
This would run the `twoSum.js` file using Node.js and display the output in the terminal window.
